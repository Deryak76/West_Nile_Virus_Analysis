# West_Nile_Virus_Analysis
**INTRODUCTION**

West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne virus and it is first seen in New York City in 1999. It has spread rapidly across the United States. The natural hosts for WNV are birds and mosquitoes. Due to  the natural transmission cycle between them, the most significant mosquito species for viral transmission are Culex species that feed on birds.

By 2004 the City of Chicago and the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) had established a comprehensive surveillance and control program. 

The goal of this project is to predict when and where different species of mosquitoes will test positive for West Nile virus.
